<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  After spending fifteen years wearing multiple hats across three different
  organizations. "Jack-of-all-trades master-of-none," really hit home for me. I
  was learning all these different sets of skills from photography, book keeping
  to IT; I was able to do a little bit of everything. It was fun being exposed
  to all facets of running an organization, being a team member to team lead and
  everything inbetween. I could touch up or put together a quick simple flyer,
  coach junior sales reps on how to close a deal, even prepare packages for
  events for international shipment, it was stimulating. I was even a runner to
  get signatures for executives at high profile banks (this was my favorite
  because I got to explore around Midtown Manhattan).
</p>

<p>
  I was very happy floating around help where I could. Like in baseball, teams
  would have a utility player, who was designated to fill most positions that
  the team, in the event one of the main players would get hurt or needed time
  off. It gave me great pleasure to step in whatever role the coach needed (or
  in this case my supervisor) fill in the vacancy. I wanted to be known as
  reliable and dependable, but what I didn't realize was I was doing more harm
  to myself then good. Yes, I got learn many different skills but I never
  excelled at any, I was only ever serviceable. After a while, I started feeling
  unhappy with where my career had been going after all these years, it was time
  for a change.
</p>

<p>
  I finally decided to take control of my career and focus on one skill, Front
  End Web Development. These past few years have been quite a journey, I first
  studied Java. This was a love hate relationship as I had struggled with
  sticking to it, but I kept bouncing around from tutorial never feeling
  confident in my skills only every really able to make a simple method to say
  "Hello World!" I would watch "how to make a person class" or "simple
  calculator." I felt confindent that I could replicate exactly what the
  instructor had just discussed, so I tried to build those myself. I came to
  realize that I had no idea how to even do this on my own.
</p>

<p>
  Frustrated I took a long break from programming, effectively abandoning Java.
  To make matters worse for my programming career, I thought that my second job
  was going to be permanent, I was learning how to run a business from the
  ground up. I felt I didn't need to continue as I would pick it up again later
  as a hobby. Too busy with the day to day operation of the business making sure
  sales leads were coming in and prepping operations with the tools they needed
  to complete client request. Never enough time to study.
</p>

<p>
  During my tenure there I realize there was a problem that needed to be solved,
  marketing the business. I went on to study everything from Google Analytics to
  <abbr>SEO</abbr> to simple <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>. It became
  my passion to promote the business. My goal was to build an amazing website
  for the business that would generating enough leads so that the owner could
  retire early.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes in life we become overtly excited about our passions that we lose
  sight of the things around us. That is exactly what happened. Yes I was making
  advancements in this digital world, but they were so subtle. My "man of many
  hats" ideaology came back to haunt me. I thought I could perform all the tasks
  assigned to me while doing all the work of a marketing and web departments
  (One man band, the lonewolf). Ultimately, I started feeling overwhelmed and
  the organization took note and had to let me go.
</p>

<p>
  Like a recurring migrane, depression came back, dehabilitating me and blinding
  me from what was around me. Normally, I would just sit there and wait for it
  to pass, secluding myself from the rest of the world (at least internally) but
  this time it was different. Instead of gritting my teeth and locking myself in
  a dark room until the pain subsided, I told myself I would find a better way
  to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
  Once the latest bout of depression was quelled, I started looking around for
  help and support on how handle this pain. In this case, I Google(d) around
  "How to learn programming" or "Where to start programming."
